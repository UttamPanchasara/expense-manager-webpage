        <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-lg">
          Unlike most finance apps, Expense Manager stores all your financial data securely on your device — no cloud sync, no external servers.
          Google Drive access is <strong class="text-white">only used when you choose to back up your data</strong> — either manually or via scheduled auto-backup.
          The app does not access or modify any other files in your Drive. Your receipts and attachments are synced only to your personal backup folder.
          No tracking. No data selling. No accounts required. Just a private, offline money manager built for people who value their financial privacy.
